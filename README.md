# OOPSProject_Medical_Management_System
The Medical Management System is an application designed to streamline and manage various aspects of medical practice, including patient records, appointments, staff management, and billing.

In this enhanced Medical Management System, file handling is used to generate, store, and manage receipts for patient transactions. This approach allows the system to produce printed or digital receipts as proof of payment for medical services, and helps in maintaining records for financial and auditing purposes.
